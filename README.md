## Introduction
Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses, especially in the telecommunications industry. This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn using various data science techniques.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
```
ðŸ“¦ telco-churn
 â”£ ðŸ“œ Telco.ipynb          # Main analysis notebook
 â”£ ðŸ“œ README.md            # Documentation
 â”£ ðŸ“œ requirements.txt     # Dependencies
 â”— ðŸ“‚ data
    â”— ðŸ“œ Telco-Customer-Churn.csv
```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). It contains information about customer demographics, account information, and services used.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telco-customer-churn.git
cd telco-customer-churn
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the analysis scripts to explore the data and build predictive models:

```bash
python scripts/analyze_data.py
python scripts/build_model.py
```

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from various sources.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Process and clean the data to make it suitable for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the data to understand patterns and relationships.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that can improve model performance.
5. **Model Building**: Build and train predictive models.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the best model for production use.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Define Objectives**: Clearly define the objectives and success criteria for the project.
2. **Data Preparation**: Collect and preprocess the data.
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Perform EDA to gain insights into the data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Engineer features to enhance model performance.
5. **Model Training**: Train multiple models and select the best one.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the models and fine-tune as necessary.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the final model and monitor its performance.

## Results
The results of the analysis and model performance will be documented here. This section will include key findings, model evaluation metrics, and any visualizations that help illustrate the results.
